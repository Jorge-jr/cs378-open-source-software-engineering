## Overview

This course provides the real-world experience of contributing to an
active open source project while receiving instruction and mentorship
from professional software engineers.  Taught by Mike McCartney,
Distinguished Engineer at PayPal, students will learn modern software
engineering techniques, discover the challenges of working on a
distributed team, and be challenged to think through what it takes to
develop a successful open source project.  Lectures will consist of a
broad range of software engineering topics and give students an
opportunity to learn from the decades of experience from professional
software engineers.

This experiential class is a continuation and expansion of work
started by Jay Borenstein (Stanford, Facebook) as a part of Facebook
Open Academy.  In this semester, students sign up and make multiple
contributions to one of 4 open source projects using Java.  Students
will be expected to setup their development environments and make
contributions via GitHub Pull Requests.  Class time will be a mixture
of lecture and project discussions.  Project discussions will include
reviewing code and discussing challenges.  Students will be expected
to make contributions to open source projects.  Contributions MUST be
accepted by maintainers to receive full credit.
