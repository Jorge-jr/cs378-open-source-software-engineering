## Status

I have my development environment up and feel comfortable making changes.

## Goal
I am going to implement the following use cases:

* As a selendroid user/developer working on Windows, I would like selendroid to pass the build tests so I can know that it is working properly and if I break any tests.

* As an android developer, I would like to test multi-touch functionality on my device/emulator so I can verify that my app handles multiple touch events correctly.

## Plan

1. I have already made a pull request to which Luke has asked for changes.
1. I will make changes to my code according to Luke's requests.
1. I will submit a new pull request with line notes explaining my changes.

1. I will work with Colin to run through the selendroid touch event code so we can understand how it currently works.
1. We will extend this knowledge to the currently minimal multi-touch code within selendroid.
1. We will create a new activity for the selendroid test-app which will allow for the testing of multi-touch events.
1. We will expand the multi-touch code to provide wrappers around common events such as pinch or rotate (similar to single touch events flick or tap).
1. We will submit a pull request for our changes and add the new functions to selendroid's multi-touch documentation.
