## Status

I have my development environment up and feel comfortable making small changes, but would like to understand more of the source code before making substantial changes.

## Goal
I am going to implement the following use cases:

* As a selendroid developer, I will investigate issues related to having multiple or no Android Virtual Devices installed when running tests without an emulator already up and running.

## Plan

1. I will work with Colin to reproduce this issue in each of our environments.
1. I will talk with Luke to see if this is an issue worth fixing.
1. I will make a plan of how to fix this after looking over the relevant code.
1. I will check with Luke to see if I have an acceptable solution.
1. I will implement my fix and make a pull request.
