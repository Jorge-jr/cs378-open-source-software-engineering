### Yo Dawg, Don't Just Watch 

[$Scope.$Watch](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/43555515.jpg) - AngularJS


## Status

* We have our development environment set up and currently looking for UI changes.

* We have updated dependencies in bower.json

* We have changed from leaflet to openlayers javascript library which is used to load, display and render maps from multiple sources on web pages.

* We are looking how to integrate javascript or jquery into AngularJS.

```javascript
/* The left and right buttons can then be use to navigate through the pages of the card */

$(document).keydown(function(e) {
    switch(e.which) {
        case 37: // left
        //make call to angular function
        break;

        case 39: // right
        //make call to angular function
        break;

        default: return; // exit this handler for other keys
    }
    e.preventDefault();
});
```


* We are looking for UI enhancement and an intuitive design of Card on the page.


## Goal

* We want to find out the reason and fix the issue of slow zooming in or zooming out on open layers when loading actual layer from geoserver.

```javascript
var wmsLayer = new ol.layer.Tile({
               		....
               		params: {LAYERS: 'basic'} //QuickStart //when using the actual layer, the layer get screwed up
               	});
```

* We would like to change the stylesheet of the site.


## Plan

1. Be proficient at AngularJS and NodeJS
1. Get familiar with Angular Directives
1. Fix the current issues of integrating openlayers
1. Implement a responsive CSS
