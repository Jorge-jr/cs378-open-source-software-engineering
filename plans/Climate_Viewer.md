##Status

We all have hadoop, zookeeper, and accumulo up and running so we should be able to start working on stuff

##Goal

* To move all of the ingest code from the geotrellis to the climate-viewer
* Updating all of the versions

##Plan

1.	Move viewer and service folders into the gt-admin repo
1.  Update scala and spark
1.  Move on to all of the dependencies that are inevitably broken
1.	Start pulling ingest code out of geotrellis until it breaks
