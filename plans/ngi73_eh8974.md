Tackling this Issue: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/378

Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Development environment is set up, can I can run test apps.
*We have found the Temp folder that is being created each time the app runs. Currently checking to see if system depeneds on the temp directory while running. 

Goal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are going to implement the following use cases:
  1. As an android developer, I would like to have control over files that my application creates 
  2. As a client, I want to minimize the clutter produced.

Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Setup debugger for Selendroid so we can step through code. [Nada and Emily] -- DONE
2. Find where in code that "Temp folder" is being created. [Nada and Emily] -- DONE
3. Design the flow of control for feature and confirm with Luke. [Emily and Nada] -- IN PROGRESS
4. Code feature! [Nada and Emily]
