## Status

I have my development environment up and feel comfortable making code changes.  I've stepped through the execution of Selendroid server stand-alone to get a feel for the architecture implementation and get better understanding of how to attack the issue I'm looking to resolve.

## Goal

I am going to implement the following use cases:

* As a selendroid developer, I'll be looking into an issue related to the presence of multiple AVDs installed or no AVDs installed when attempting to test.

## Plan

1. I will reproduce the issue consistently and check for other boundary cases (like no AVD's installed)
1. I will discuss the issue with Luke and make sure it's worth tackling
1. I will make a plan for how to address the issue
1. I will discuss aspects of the plan with Luke or Mike
1. I will implement the plan in a new branch and make a pull request.
