## Status

I am currently working on adding my doccumentation to the selendroid wiki.
I am also gearing up to make a pull request to improve selendroid-test-app for testing touch gestures.

## Goal

I am going to:

* Make any additions to my doccumentation based on any feedback recieved.

* Work with Cameron toward implementing multi-touch gestures.

## Plan

1. An issue has been opened to request a maintainer add my doccumentation.  I'll keep an eye on the issue for feedback.
1. Figure out how to get maven to resolve android.support.v4.view.GestureDetectorCompat;
1. Submit pull request for improved selendroid-test-app
1. Determine if multi-touch as implemented works properly.
1. (if not) debug currently implemented multitouch
1. (if not) fix multitouch
1. (if not) submit pull request for multitouch support
